This is my github repositary where I will be making notes and practicing code from eloquent JavaScript -  A wonderful textbook by Marjin Haverbeke. Why JS? It is widely popular language, and alhtouhg it has a very flexible method of writing code, which can be not quite fruitful for someone like me who has experience in CPP, there are still wonders I can do with this language. It has nothing to do with my experience with Java, because Java is mostly OOP language, compared to C/C++, which are to understand the fundamental. I have notes, and brief documentation of JS, thoroughly in two different branches.
